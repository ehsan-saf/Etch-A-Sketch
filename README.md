# Etch-A-Sketch
I made a websie with a grid that you can draw on when you move the mouse over the grid while holding down the left button on the mouse.
In the settings section you can change the drawing color,change grid size by changing the slider, choose the colorful drawing mode (rianbow) which fills in the squares with a random color everytime you move the mouse over a square
and at the bottom you have a clear button that removes any colored squares in the grid
